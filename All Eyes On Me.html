In it, he shows behind the scenes of the making of <em>Inside</em>, offering more songs/snippets that didn’t make the original cut, and an alternative version of “All Eyes On Me,” arguably the most notable and important song from <em>Inside</em>. <br/><br/>My visual representation of lyrics uses formatting to convey the song’s textual subject matter and cognitive processes of the viewers. <br/><br/>The lines of lyrics use Gestalt’s principle of Continuity/Continuation to keep lyrics in order, while also displaying them weaving in and out with the other voice’s lyrics. The lines also textually represent ocean waves/water mentioned within the lyrics.<br/><br/></span>
  
  <span style="color: black; font-size: 25px; font-family: Jost; font-weight: 400; line-height: 37.50px; word-wrap: break-word"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5XWEVoI40sE" style="color: black; text-decoration: none;"> “All Eyes On Me (The Outtakes Version)” music video</a> is similar to the originally published “All Eyes On Me” from <em>Inside</em> in that Burnham presents himself in duplicate. In the original <em>Inside</em>, most of the video shows Burnham performing in front of a camera, with that live feed projected upon the wall behind him. In “The Outtakes Version,” the video includes two frames of Burnham performing side by side (see image below). One is “grungy” with a narrow depth of field (meaning he is out of focus if he moves forwards and backwards); the second is overlaid with a harsh green filter (presumably using an infrared lens) that has altered his appearance, making him look grotesque. <br/><br/><br/></span></div>

About halfway through, they sing over top of each other, with the video presenting both frames side by side, causing confusion and disorientation in the listener’s ability to understand the lyrics, though each “version” of Burnham sings lines that are mostly from the original song.  My lyrics present two colors of text, each with a different font, to connote the two distinct voices: grungy and green. <br/><br/>I chose orange and cyan as the colors of the lyrics to match the color calibration of traditional Red/Blue 3D movie glasses. (Grungy lyrics are found in cyan, and grotesque green lyrics are in orange.) In doing so, the effect is such that closing one eye cancels out one “set” of lyrics, while closing the other eye cancels the other set. For example, if a viewer closes the “red” eye, which then leaves them looking solely through a blue lens, they can only see the orange lyrics. If they open the “red” eye, but close the “blue” eye, then they see only the cyan lyrics. Shared words in the lyrics are formatted in purple to ensure that both lenses can detect it. In this way, viewers can literally “choose” which voice they follow along with, opting to only “see” one voice at a time. In this way, the choosing of “filters” or the choosing of “what is seen/heard” is a symbolic act (we meet again, J. L. Austin!). <br/><br/>With both eyes open, the effect is “trippy” or disorienting. In my experience (and others’ who have “experienced” my work), my eyes battle for which color of lyrics my brain wants to focus upon.  Depending on which lyrics my eyes are actively reading (as opposed to passively seeing), that correlating singing voice becomes clearer and easier to listen to while the other voice fades to the background. However, the act of my eyes literally battling to be the dominant eye that my brain uses to process information causes a sense of fuzziness and confusion that is almost indescribable ("transcendent" is a word one of my friends used to describe her experience), much like the effect the song has on listeners. At one point, my eyes give up fighting each other and start to unfocus. After my eyes relax, the lyrics start to jump off the screen, intertwining not only in 2D (up/down, left/right), but also in 3D, floating front/back from the screen. Slightly moving eyes/head left and right to read along makes this effect even more extreme. At the very end, the last 3 lines are sung in unison, so I used a 3D anaglyph to make those lines literally stand off the screen together. <br/><br/>I took inspiration from the vinyl records of <em>Inside</em>. The records come encased with red, blue, and green acetate sleeves that cover the jackets (or cases). Photos on the jackets are two (or three)-toned printed so different images appear depending on which sleeve is slipped over the jacket. I wanted to play with this notion that listeners can choose which “filter” they use to view Burnham’s work. However, the two simultaneous voices in the song facilitated the need for two filters to be used at once, hence using 3D glasses for a double filter input. <br/><br/>The waviness of the lines was influenced by the juxtaposing lyrics of “Get your fuckin’ hands up” and “Heads down, pray for us.” This up and down movement mirrors the emotional roller coaster that is <em>Inside</em>. Viewers can be laughing in one segment, then immediately be forced to witness Burnham’s devastating existential crisis. The lyrics also mimic words from the song. Burnham mentions the rising level of the ocean, so I wanted the lyrics to look like waves, intertwining together. Not only that, the wave line was meant to simulate the speed and duration that Burnham sings. For example, the third line of blue text, beginning with “You don’t wanna play right now,” has a lot of waves, frequency if you will, that embodies the quickness with which Burnham sings. Readers have to read quickly, up and down, to keep up with the song’s pace, followed by a single-sloped lyric that slows the pace not the tempo, but rather the rate of sung lyrics. Using visual attributions to draw listener’s attention to tempo and pace, along with movements that represented the content of the lyrics, and, what I think is, the natural “flow” of rhythm in this song. <br/><br/>Seeing the duplicitously visualized lyrics, weaving together with red/blue glasses, impels readers to experience disorientation in a supplemental, yet, strangely, harmonious way. In other words, the way in which many experienced the COVID-19 pandemic, or experience anxiety/depression, or experience performativity. <br/></span></div>
