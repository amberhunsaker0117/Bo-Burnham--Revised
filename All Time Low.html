Like many of his songs, the style and tone (up-beat, peppy) of the song “Shit” juxtaposes the dark subject matter of self-deprecation, which leads into “ATL.”<br/><br/>“All Time Low” opens with despondent dialogue that sets Burnham’s rapidly declining mental health to the state of an “all time low,” then quickly transitions into another up-beat, peppy melody that depicts what it feels like to experience a panic/anxiety attack, a move that mirrors the tone of “Shit.” “ATL” ends ends with more despondent, spoken dialogue admitting that his declining mental health is “not great.”<br/><br/>My visualized lyrics appear like a movie-poster, carrying with it symbolism that embodies declining mental health. <br/><br/>Different fonts distinguish the dialogue from the sung lyrics, with stereotypical “word bubbles” to represent the “third party” voice that demands that Burnham “describe” his feelings. <br/><br/>The “positive space” looks like a zoomed-in knife with a bevel, and drops of blood at the tip. This imagery plays into the gruesome and dangerous undertones of living with mental health. Contrastingly, the “negative space,” or the black space, makes the knife look like a funnel, or the actual “tunnel vision” commonly associated with panic/anxiety attacks, all coming to the drop of blood, the point of injury (physical or mental). <br/><br/>I intentionally made this “poster” long or tall, as to require readers to scroll down, lessening the amount of words visible on screen as the song progresses, increasing the black border, leading to the exclamation “point" that is the blood drop. At first, viewers don’t have to scroll a lot, then, as the song progresses, viewers must scroll faster and faster to keep up with the lyrics. This emulates the panicky feeling that comes with having anxiety and experiencing a panic attack.<br/><br/>This song and lyric display are both particularly personal to me because I have anxiety, and I didn’t know it.<br/><br/>One of my friends (ironically the one with whom I first watched <em>Inside</em>) asked me, “Amber, how do you deal with your anxiety?” And with 100% genuineness, I responded, “What? I don’t have anxiety.” <br/><br/>Yes. Yes, in fact, I do. Little did I know that not everyone lives with an eternal rock in their gut. Other humans don’t look at Google Map traffic patterns to see if there was a car accident on the route their spouse takes home just because they are 2 minutes late. Most people don’t make “What If?” contingency plans for all their plans--no matter how trivial those plans are. Anxiety free persons didn’t think they had brain tumors, Schizophrenia, or autoimmune diseases in their twenties because they felt their skin crawl nearly every day. Non-panic-attack-experiencers don’t think they are dying when someone says, “We need to talk.” These things are normal, right? Doesn’t everyone feel this way? At least I thought so.<br/><br/>How could I have not-known I had anxiety?    <br/><br/>Bo Burnham has openly shared about his struggle with anxiety. A struggle that mirrors mine. He struggled with health issues in high school, not knowing he had anxiety, despite many signs that indicated so (Klein). “All Time Low” depicts this struggle with anxiety, and I knew I wanted to convey to neurotypical people the absolute horror of experiencing a panic attack. The sense of dread. Feeling like there’s no escape, no room, no end. <br/><br/>Initially, the “tunnel vision” image I had in mind would have been like the opening credit of any <em>James Bond</em> movie, looking at an image through a bullet hole. The lyrics could have been tiny, like bottom of the optometrist eyesight chart, to indicate how far away they seem from the viewer. But in the spirit of trying to make lyrics a bit more accessible, and even dynamic, the funnel idea with required quickening scrolling seemed like a way to tap into the tightness and downward spiral that comes with panic attacks. <br/><br/>When I sketched the idea out for my friend (the same one who watched <em>Inside</em> with me for the first time, told me I had anxiety, and is a board-certified optometrist (hey, Maranda!)), she immediately saw the funnel as a knife and proposed I add the bevel to make it seem more menacing. My downward spiral outline became a weapon that anxiety held to my throat. It was a perfect match for the lyrics.<br/><br/>This knife image mirrors a snippet (not expanded upon in this project) elsewhere in <em>Inside</em> where Burnham holds a knife in a threatening way, while paradoxically thanking his viewers for their support.<br/><br/>Yet another reminder that media, like mental illness, holds us hostage. Explored even further in the next song.<br/>   </span></div>
