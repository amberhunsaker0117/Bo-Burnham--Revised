 <div style="width: 1100px; height: 1660px; left: 50%; transform: translateX(-50%); top: 8195px; position: absolute; text-align: justify; justify-content: center; display: flex; flex-direction: column"><span style="color: black; font-size: 25px; font-family: Jost; font-weight: 400; line-height: 37.50px; word-wrap: break-word">This song/snippet appears in the first half of the special, following a rant about how people can’t “shut the fuck up,” arguing that everyone has opinions to share about everything. The “'Unpaid Intern'” clip is particularly ironic because it follows the rant. Burnham literally “does the thing” he’s frustrated about (hello, J. L. Austin's speech act)– he can’t stop talking and has something to say all the time. In fact, he has many things to say, without actually contributing anything.<br/><br/>This clip begins with a short song detailing the exploitation of unpaid interns in the corporate world. The video then cuts to Burnham “reacting” to that song. The reaction video then starts to repeat, causing the narrating Burnham to have to react to his reaction, over the course of several repetitions. His reaction narration turns self-deprecating, ultimately criticizing himself for needing to be liked and making excuses for his behavior/comments. Because the song and the numerous running commentary videos play simultaneously, I felt this was a prime example of how traditionally formatted closed captioning can misrepresent, or even miss entirely, key elements of the media. <br/><br/>In an episode of <em>This Rhetorical Life</em> discussing captioning, Sean Zdenek argues that captioning “needs to be driven by the rhetorical purpose, maybe genre too, the context, the audience’s needs.” I argue that the literal cacophony of voices in the “‘Unpaid Intern’ Reaction Video” snippet is the primary purpose in this video, yet the captions only display the “main” narration voice. By providing all the words said by the various iterations of the reacting Burnhams and presenting the changing tone of the “main” narrator through color and font choices, my lyrical presentation seeks to visually convey Burnham’s purpose of showcasing all the many voices that can’t “shut the fuck up.”<br/><br/>The font styles become progressively more unsettling, beginning with a neutral font in orange, then adding a more personal, handwritten font in blue (making these complementary colors to indicate the original, unassuming beginning of the piece). Next a dark purple, an analogous color to blue, with a font similar, but more jagged and harsh. Next is green, with a font that changes the angles and line weights of letters to seem disjointed and inconsistent, ending with a dark, blood red (complementary of green to show the strong connection of losing patience) font that looks like blood dripping down, being thicker at the top of the letters, narrowing toward the bottom. It’s meant to stand out against the other voices to emphasize Burnham’s insistence that he wants to stop the noise–his noise. The noise he himself is making. <br/><br/>The line placement correlates with the timing of the said line. For example, in the first narration, the blue text begins before the orange text because that narrated line begins speaking before the orange line is sung. The same rule is true for lines found after the lyrics. At the very end when Burnham says, "And then you cut," those words are spoken after the last orange lyrics are sung. Presenting the lines in relation to timing of each other on the left-right axis helps the reader spatially see the aural relationship of the lyrics/narration.<br/><br/>When I was thinking about how to capture the auditory experience of this piece in a visual way, I wanted readers to experience disorientation and over-stimulation. I thought about overlaying words on top of each other to mimic the overlaying of sounds. Something like this:</span></div>

Giving up trying defeats the purpose of captions/writing out the lyrics-- you know, to read the lyrics. Instead, I wanted to format the lyrics in a way that the individual words are clearly seen and the speaker of the words is clearly identified, hence my using of multi-colors/fonts. But I didn’t think the mutli-colors/fonts were enough chaos to encapsulate the tone of the piece. Line proximity had to be the method with which to enact the cacophony of noise.<br/><br/>I started by writing out the song lyrics, with a lot of space between them. Then when the dialogue begins, line by line, literally second by second, I typed out the text of the first Burnham speaker, being sure to align and anchor them to words in the song lyrics. The same process happened as each new speaker enters the video. I probably listened to that video for three hours. It was tedious work. <br/><br/>When I was done making a digital file that shows multi-colors/fonts aligned and anchored together, I had to laugh. <br/><br/>This particular lyric set was the first thing I did for this entire project. And it was for a class discussion board. Not even a major assignment. Approximately 6 hours of my life went to this creation--all for about 3% of a grade in a Rhetorical Theory class. But hey, it led me to investigate Burnham more closely and opened up space for more creative, yet rhetorical, displays of his lyrics.</span></div>
